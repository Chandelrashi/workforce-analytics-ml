# Workforce Analytics Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository presents an applied machine learning workflow for analysing and predicting workforce trends such as attrition risk and workforce demand. The project demonstrates how structured workforce data can be transformed into actionable insights using data science techniques.

The work is based on applied experience across academic research and industry analytics and is intended for educational and illustrative purposes.

## Problem Statement
Workforce data is often fragmented across multiple systems, making it difficult to generate predictive insights using traditional reporting approaches. This project explores how machine learning models can be used to identify patterns and support proactive workforce planning.

## Methodology
The workflow includes:
- Data extraction and preprocessing using Python and Pandas
- Feature engineering incorporating tenure and temporal metrics
- Model development using supervised learning techniques
- Model evaluation using standard performance metrics

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- SQL (conceptual)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Repository Structure
- `data/` – Sample dataset (synthetic)
- `notebooks/` – Exploratory analysis and modelling
- `src/` – Reusable model pipeline code

## Disclaimer
All data used in this repository is synthetic or anonymised. No confidential or proprietary information is included.
